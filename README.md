Also known as ‚ÄúThe Greatest Show On Earth‚Äù, The carnival of Rio de Janeiro takes place every year in the month of February or March. The festival is celebrated for five days that precede Ash Wednesday with millions of visitors.

The most fascinating part of Carnival is the Grand Samba Parades for which top Samba schools prepare all year and compete against each year for the title of Rio de Janeiro Carnival Champion and a million dollar reward. Sambodromo stadium is the open-air venue or the meeting point of the carnival where tourists are entertained with the parades among the Samba schools.

However, The Sambodrome Parade is not the only highlight of this Carnival! Before and after the main parades, dozens of street parties are held across the city. These parties are more casual than the parades in Sambodrome.
